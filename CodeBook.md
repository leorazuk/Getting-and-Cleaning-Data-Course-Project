TRANSFORMATION STEPS:

	1: Download zip file for assingment (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
	2: Unzip files in "wd"/data.
	3: Load data frames for activity_labels.txt (activityLabels), features.txt (features), subject_test.txt (subjectTest), y_test.txt (yTest), X_test.txt (xTest), subject_train.txt (subjectTrain), y_train.txt (yTrain) and X_train.txt (xTrain)
	4: Transform variables yTest$activity and yTrain$activity in factors, with levels defined by activityLabels$activityName (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
	5: Creates a logical vector called meanAndStdVariableIndices indicating the indices in featues of measurements of means and standard deviations.
	6: Creates a factor vector called meanAndStdVariableNames whith names in features of measurements of means and standard deviations.
	7: Creates a data frame named test by subsetting from xTest the measurements of means and standard deviations using the logical vector created in step 5 (meanAndStdVariableIndices).
	8: Changes the names of the variables in test using the factor vector created in step 6 (meanAndStdVariableNames).
	9: Binds the subjects ids from subjectTest in test as its first column.
	10: Binds the activities from yTest in test as its first column.
	11: Creates a data frame named train by subsetting from xTrain the measurements of means and standard deviations using the logical vector created in step 5 (meanAndStdVariableIndices).
	12: Changes the names of the variables in train using the factor vector created in step 6 (meanAndStdVariableNames).
	13: Binds the subjects ids column from subjectTrain in train as its first column.
	14: Binds the activities column from yTrain in train as its first column.
	15: Creates a data frame named testAndTrainData by binding the rows of train in test.
	16: Creates a data frame named testAndTrainForActivityAndSubjectData with the measurements means of testAndTrainData grouped by activity and subject.
